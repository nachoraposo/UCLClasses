# Blanchard Chapter 7: Organization for System Engineering

Organization is the *combination of resources in a manner that it fullils a certain need*. These "Resources" can be human, technological or physical; and need to be aligned in order to accomplish the set the intended objectives. Organizational structures will vary depending on the active constraints such as objetives, resources available, communications, motivation and working relationships amongst the involved actors.

In short, their main objective is to achieve the most effective and efficient use of resources by establishing communications and desicion-making processes designed around defined objectives.

## 7.1 Developing the Organizational Structure

When dealing with organizations, we must address a number of considerations such as structure, processes, culture, environment and their inter-connections. 
### Developing and Organizational Structure

* The first step is to identify and characterize the goals and objectives of the general organizations purpose.
* Then, which are the main functions required to achieve those goals and objectives.
Depending on the complexity, size and scope of a "program", the structue might assume one of this configurations:
* Functional:
* Project: 
* Matrix:
* Hybrid combination:

### In terms of Systems Engineering
*In regard to system engineering, a prime objective during the early stages of conceptual design is to ensure the proper development of system-level requirements;that is, the needs analysis, feasibility analysis, operational requirements, maintenanceconcept, identification of technical performance measures (TPMs), and the preparation of the system specification (Type A). These activities are highly customer/user focused and directed toward the system as an entity.*

#### Important
Experience indicates that there are organizational departments/groups located within industrial firms and/or government agencies that have been designated as system engineering and assigned the appropriate responsibilities but are not performing the tasks required.

## 7.2 Customer, Producer and Supplier Relationships

the system designed should take into account the complete context of the organizational nature for the initiative. Custome-Producer relations should be modeled, adapted and structured according to the individual landscape, if the dynamics will be completely internal, or there is dependence of outside entities which need to be coordinated. *It is imperative that the systems engineering of Producer-Supplier relationships must be clearly defined from the beggining* 

**The basic responsibility for fulfilling the objectives described throughout this text lies with the producerâ€™s organization, with supporting tasks being accomplished by individual suppliers as required**

Extensive informal and formal commication is required within entities involved in the system development effort.Good bidirectional communications and the use of concurrent engineering principles is key for a succesful *teaming or partnership* implementation. In other words, keep communications channels open to dialogue for clarity and maintain the veracity in the communication.

## 7.3 Customer Organization and Functions

The customer is the final user and the one that needs the requirements met, or a representative for these interests.
