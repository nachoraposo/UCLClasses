# Blanchard Chapter 7: Organization for System Engineering

Organization is the *combination of resources in a manner that it fullils a certain need*. These "Resources" can be human, technological or physical; and need to be aligned in order to accomplish the set the intended objectives. Organizational structures will vary depending on the active constraints such as objetives, resources available, communications, motivation and working relationships amongst the involved actors.

In short, their main objective is to achieve the most effective and efficient use of resources by establishing communications and desicion-making processes designed around defined objectives.

## 7.1 Developing the Organizational Structure

When dealing with organizations, we must address a number of considerations such as structure, processes, culture, environment and their inter-connections. 
### Developing and Organizational Structure

* The first step is to identify and characterize the goals and objectives of the general organizations purpose.
* Then, which are the main functions required to achieve those goals and objectives.
Depending on the complexity, size and scope of a "program", the structue might assume one of this configurations:
* Functional:
* Project: 
* Matrix:
* Hybrid combination:

### In terms of Systems Engineering
*In regard to system engineering, a prime objective during the early stages of conceptual design is to ensure the proper development of system-level requirements;that is, the needs analysis, feasibility analysis, operational requirements, maintenanceconcept, identification of technical performance measures (TPMs), and the preparation of the system specification (Type A). These activities are highly customer/user focused and directed toward the system as an entity.*

#### Important
Experience indicates that there are organizational departments/groups located within industrial firms and/or government agencies that have been designated as system engineering and assigned the appropriate responsibilities but are not performing the tasks required.

## 7.2 Customer, Producer and Supplier Relationships

the system designed should take into account the complete context of the organizational nature for the initiative. Custome-Producer relations should be modeled, adapted and structured according to the individual landscape, if the dynamics will be completely internal, or there is dependence of outside entities which need to be coordinated. *It is imperative that the systems engineering of Producer-Supplier relationships must be clearly defined from the beggining* 

**The basic responsibility for fulfilling the objectives described throughout this text lies with the producer’s organization, with supporting tasks being accomplished by individual suppliers as required**

Extensive informal and formal commication is required within entities involved in the system development effort.Good bidirectional communications and the use of concurrent engineering principles is key for a succesful *teaming or partnership* implementation. In other words, keep communications channels open to dialogue for clarity and maintain the veracity in the communication.

## 7.3 Customer Organization and Functions

The customer is the final user that sets the requirements to satisfy a need, or it could also be an external representative for these interests.

### Who is the ultimate "Customer"?
It is essential that this overall “chain” of organizational entities be addressed in the planning and development of systems.

*Comment: 
from a strategic point of view the sum of the parts must make up for the whole of the intended scope. If the system is ill engineeried, the scope will only be partly satisfied due to the lack of coherence between the conceptual ideation and the practical application.*

*From an operational standpoint, the customer is the next sub-system where i need to deliver the equirements according to their tactical specification*


The industrial
firm has been held responsible for the design, development, production, and delivery
of a system in response to certain specified requirements. However, the customer has
not always provided the producer with the necessary data and/or controls to allow
the development effort to proceed in accordance with good system engineering
practices. At the same time, the customer has not performed the necessary functions
of system engineering management. The net result has been the development of systems without the consideration of many of the characteristics discussed throughout
Chapter 3; that is, systems that are unreliable, not maintainable, not supportable, not
cost-effective, and not responsive to the needs of the ultimate users.

 is essential that the responsibility
for system engineering be established from the beginning. The customer must clarify
system objectives and program functions, and the requirements for system engineering must be well defined.


In the event that the system engineering responsibility is delegated to the producer (i.e., the preceding second option), the customer must completely support this
decision by providing the necessary top-down guidance and managerial backing.
Responsibilities must be properly delineated, system-level data generated through
earlier customer activities and studies made available to the producer (e.g., the results
of feasibility analyses, the documentation of operational requirements), and the producer must be given the necessary leeway relative to making decisions at the system
level. The challenge for the customer is to prepare a good, comprehensive, wellwritten, and clear SOW to be implemented by the producer. The emphasis should
be on the issues of producer performance, specifying what needs to be accomplished
and when, versus telling the producer how to perform the job. In addition, the various
lines of communication between the customer and producer shown in Figure 7.1 must
support a unified and consistent approach throughout.


*comments*
*We are either handed the strategic planning already performed by the customer, or we have to develop it ourselves to cope with the needs of the customer. In the first case, there is the advantage that the plan was drafted by an entity that has domain knowledge, however, there could be unintended situations where the sistem was not well characterised or misunderstood by the supplier, manifesting in partial failure to meet the objectives*

*On the other hand, scoping the system as a supplier gives control and responisbility for the result to meet the customer's needs, however there is a lack of domain knowledge that has to be overcome.*

*In case that the client does not have a clear idea of the requirements, a variable-scope approach has to be taken to start addressing the uncertainty over the needs and discovering the most important/impactful requirements, and shape the scopes down to design vertically solutions/products for the discovered requirements.*
